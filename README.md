2D javascript FPS wip

Trying to make a game using javascript. No dedicated high-level library. Canvas-based.

Specifics of the expected gameplay:
- 2D FPS with limited sight

TODOs:
- Limit sight, following the crosshair
- shoot bouncy lasers
- design gameplay for the sight limitation (moving, aiming phases, recoil...)

- map loader
- map maker from polygons in png (python)

- server-client
- deathmatch gameplay

Optimizations:
- reduce calculation of sight
- quicker visibility mask update
